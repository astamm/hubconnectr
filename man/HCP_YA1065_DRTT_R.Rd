\description{
HCP-YA1065 atlas is an updated atlas from HCP-YA842 atlas. The
new atlas is based on \href{https://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009}{ICBM 2009a Nonlinear Asymmetric}
space, whereas HCP-YA842 is based on FSLâ€™s FA map (58 FA images averaged to
old MNI152). The new atlas further provides subcomponents for cingulum,
SLF, corticopontine track, corticostriatal track, corticothalamic track
(renamed as thalamic radiation).

\details{
In R, fascicles are stored as an object of class \code{maf_df} which
inherits from \code{tbl_df}, \code{tbl} and \code{data.frame} and stores, in each row,
information about a single 3D point. At a bare minimum, 5 variables are
stored for each point:
\itemize{
\item \code{X}, \code{Y}, \code{Z}: 3D coordinates of the current point;
\item \code{PointId}: Identification number of the current point among all points of
the streamline it belongs to;
\item \code{StreamlineId}: Identification number of the streamline which the current
point belongs to.
