The goal of [**mascot**](https://astamm.github.io/mascot/) is to provide easy access to recent macroscale
structural connectomes of the Human brain obtained from diffusion MRI data
through diffusion modeling and subsequent so-called tractography.

## Datasets

Currently, the package contains:

- the HCP-YA845 and HCP-YA1065 tractography atlases from Yeh FC, Panesar S,
Fernandes D, Meola A, Yoshino M, Fernandez-Miranda JC, Vettel JM, Verstynen T.
Population-averaged atlas of the macroscale human structural connectome and its
network topology. Neuroimage. 2018 Sep 1;178:57-68 (2021 update).

Each white matter fascicle comes in the form of a
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org) in which each row is a point
characterized by the following five variables:

- `X`, `Y`, `Z`: 3D coordinates of the current point; 
- `PointId`: Identification number of the current point among all points of the
streamline it belongs to;
- `StreamlineId`: Identification number of the streamline which the current
point belongs to.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mascot from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("astamm/mascot")
```
